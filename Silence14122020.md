I am living with various repetitive memories on repeat in my head and I can't escape them.
None are full memories and I cant work out the exact order. 
I hope they aren't real.
I can ignore them if i have a small distraction.
I can't sit in silence with someone.
I had to sit in silence playing video games in a weirdly shaped chair.
I think it was a PS2 and i think the usual game was a Simpsons game.
I always had to be quiet and avoid talking but at those times I had to be silent.
I also had to be silent at the squash club during hide and seek and when he took me into the boys toilets so no one would find us.
I wasn't allowed to tell anyone it was our secret game and friends, especially good friends, had secrets.
I didn't really have any good/ best friend's.
Only Count Olaf, everyone else put up with me but still treated me as if i was an alien.
I must have deserved it as no one protected me.
My sister didn't deserve it and my parents would never believe me.
Count Olaf had been raised with me as if he was my older brother and they never believed me when I told them what happened at school.
If i didn't do it he would make my sister do it and she didn't deserve it so i let it happen to me to protect her.
I think it happened a lot as i remember feeling numb about it when it happened.
It was something i didn't like but i had to put up with.
It made me feel weird rather than scared most of the time but i also couldn't understand what was happening at the time.
I also felt used to it towards the end.
If it had to happen to me or someone else, i would let it happen to me again.
I want to talk to BlackHole about this.
She might listen and try to understand me more than most people.
I miss hugging her in bed.
I kind of felt safe or at least i was fairly sure she would not do bad stuff to me.
I miss listening to her heartbeat, it was a useful guide when i felt like i couldn't breathe.
It made me feel less lonely and scared.
I didn't think i was waiting for Count Olaf to wait for everyone else to be asleep to do bad things to me.
She told me she would protect me and I believed her which was probably stupid as she eventually hurt me.
I dont think she would protect me again.
It is also ironic as she triggered something in my brain. 
She couldn't handle it and I lost her so i now have to relive this series of unfortunate events alone again.
