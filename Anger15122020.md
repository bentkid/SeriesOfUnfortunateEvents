I am angry at BlackHole because she could make me feel safer than anyone else could.
I let myself get close to her and her get close to me.
I started to really trust her but I also started to remeber what happened the last time i let this happen.
I think she saw something was wrong and said i could talk about it if i wanted to.
It was probably a trap as the more i talked about it the more it made her not like me anymore.
Maybe she was fed up with me.
I am angry at her for making me feel safe when i wasn't.
I lost her because she couldn't handle it and now i have to relive it again alone.
I think this time may be worse as I understand what happened.
It wasn't a secret game that would correct me.
It would almost break me.
I think that could have been Count Olaf's real objective, to break me.
But im still here.
I still like girls but i dont think i will ever date one as I dont think i can be loved.
Im not sure if trusting people in the hope of being loved and feeling safe is worth it.
